Hi, I'm Rayyan Cyclegar, current high schooler and programming enthusiast.

Over here, I'll occasionally write about tech, and sometimes about non-tech.

You can find me and my projects over on my [GitHub](https://github.com/AbooMinister25).

If you want to get in touch with me, you can do so through my email, [aboominister@gmail.com](mailto:aboominister@gmail.com), or on Discord through the user `aboominister`.
