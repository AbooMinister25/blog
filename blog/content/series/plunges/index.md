Computer science is a pretty vast discipline, and there is no shortage of resources documenting various aspects of this discipline. There's no shortage of topics that I've been wanting to research, but repeatedly it is either my time or my motivation (due in part to a lack of structure) that impedes me.

So, largely for my sake, I've decided to start this series. I've compiled a (perpetually updating) list of topics that I want to do deep dives into. After a few weeks of research, I'll create a blog post in a pedagogical format which summarizes and explains whatever I've found, much to my benefit since it'll give me some long needed structure and a tangible goal to reach, and hopefully to a reader's enjoyment. Ideally, we'd both learn something out of this.

I lack a schedule, but I estimate that I'll have a new _plunge_ every one to two months, giving me time to research, write, and balance whatever work and activities I have going on in my life.

Post will be long-form, and ideally accessibly written.

Yes, we're calling these plunges.
