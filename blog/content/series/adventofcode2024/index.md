In this series I document my puzzle solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2024.

Advent of Code is a series of themed programming puzzles of increasing difficulty that are released throughout December up until Christmas.

All of my solutions are [on github](https://github.com/AbooMinister25/adventofcode2024).
