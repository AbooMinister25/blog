For AP Lit, I had to pick two books by an author and read them, recording my progress and reflecting on the contents along the way.

The author I picked was R.F. Kuang, who wrote _Babel_ and _Yellowface_, both of which were incrediby enjoyable to read. I have six entries for each book, made up of summary, and analysis/reflection.
