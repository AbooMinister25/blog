# Blog

This repository hosts the source code for my personal blog, where I occasionally write about tech, and sometimes about non-tech.

## Details

This repository consists of two components, a static site generator which takes my blog posts, stored in the `contents/` folder, and emits a static HTML site to the `public/` folder. The other component is a web server, which serves my site, with some extra features like full text search (yes, that does mean this isn't an _entirely_ static site, but whatever).

## Building

TODO

Keep in mind, if you want a static site generator, this probably isn't for you. It is first and foremost a personal tool, with no guarantees of being regularly maintained (or having the best code and architecture, for that matter).
