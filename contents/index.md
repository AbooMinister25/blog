Hi, I'm Rayyan Cyclegar, high school student and programming enthusiast. Over here, I'll write about tech, and occasionally about non-tech. My main areas of interest are language design and web development, but I'm open to pretty much whatever. I'm also a staffer over at the [Python Discord](https://discord.gg/python), so you'll be able to catch me hanging out over there.

You can find me and my projects on [Github](https://github.com/AbooMinister25).

If you want to get in touch with me, you can do so through my email, [aboominister@gmail.com](mailto:aboominister@gmail.com), or on Discord, through the user `AbooMinister#8971`.
